## Overview

**Components** are reusable blocks you create once and use in multiple emails. They help maintain visual consistency and speed up email creation. Think of them as email "Lego blocks" with a shared design system.

## Component vs Email

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Component (Master)" icon="package">
    **Stored in component library**
    
    - Fixed design structure
    - Reusable across multiple emails
    - Editable from the library
    - Changes propagate to all emails using it
    - Single source of truth for design
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email (Instance)" icon="mail">
    **Individual email template**
    
    - Contains component instances
    - Can override content via overrides
    - Complete email structure
    - Design inherits from component master
    - Can have multiple component instances
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating a Component

You can create components in two ways:

<Steps>
  <Step title="From email editor">
    Select multiple elements in an email, then convert them to a component. The selected elements become the component's structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="From library">
    Create a new empty component in the library, then add elements to it using the editor.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Component Structure

A component contains:

- **Properties**: Metadata (name, type, visual properties like background, padding)
- **Children**: Hierarchical element structure (same as emails)
- **Style Library**: Uses the same design tokens as emails

## Using Components in Emails

When you insert a component into an email, it becomes an **instance** of that component:

<Info>
  The instance references the master component. You can override content (text, links, image URLs), but the design stays linked to the master component.
</Info>

### Example: Newsletter Header Component

**Component Master** (in library):
- Logo image
- Title text ("Weekly Newsletter")
- Navigation menu

**Instance in Email 1**:
- Uses master design (logo, colors, spacing)
- Override: Title text → "Product Updates"

**Instance in Email 2**:
- Uses master design (same as Email 1)
- Override: Title text → "Monthly Digest"
- Override: Logo image → Different logo

<Warning>
  If you change the master component's design (colors, spacing, layout), both Email 1 and Email 2 automatically update with the new design. Only content overrides are preserved.
</Warning>

## Component Types

Components can contain any type of element:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simple elements">
    Text, buttons, images, separators, social links—all work inside components.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Structural elements">
    Groups, multi-columns, and sections can be part of a component structure.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Nested components">
    Components can contain other components (though be careful not to create circular references).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="🎯 Single purpose">
    Each component should have a clear, single purpose (e.g., "Header", "Footer", "CTA Button").
  </Card>
  <Card title="🎨 Use design tokens">
    Build components using tokens from your Style Library, not manual values.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📝 Name clearly">
    Use descriptive names like "Product Card" or "Newsletter Header" instead of "Component 1".
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔄 Keep reusable">
    If you find yourself copying elements often, it's a good candidate for a component.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Component Library

Your component library is accessible from:

- The main navigation menu
- The email editor (insert component button)
- The component editor (for editing existing components)

<Info>
  Components are account-wide, so all your emails can use any component you've created.
