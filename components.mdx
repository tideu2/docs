## Overview

**Components** are reusable blocks you create once and use in multiple emails. They help maintain visual consistency and speed up email creation. Think of them as email "Lego blocks" with a shared design system.

## Component vs Email

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Component (Master)" icon="package">
    **Stored in component library**
    
    - Fixed design structure
    - Reusable across multiple emails
    - Editable from the library
    - Changes propagate to all emails using it
    - Single source of truth for design
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email (Instance)" icon="mail">
    **Individual email template**
    
    - Contains component instances
    - Can override content via overrides
    - Complete email structure
    - Design inherits from component master
    - Can have multiple component instances
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating a Component

You can create components in two ways:

<Steps>
  <Step title="From email editor">
    Select multiple elements in an email, then convert them to a component. The selected elements become the component's structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="From library">
    Create a new empty component in the library, then add elements to it using the editor.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Component Structure

A component contains:

- **Properties**: Metadata (name, type, visual properties like background, padding)
- **Children**: Hierarchical element structure (same as emails)
- **Style Library**: Uses the same design tokens as emails

### Example Component Structure

```json
{
  "id": "header-newsletter",
  "name": "Newsletter Header",
  "type": "component",
  "properties": {
    "backgroundColor": "#FFFFFF",
    "padding": "20px"
  },
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "image",
      "src": "https://example.com/logo.png",
      "alt": "Company Logo"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Newsletter Title",
      "textStyleId": "h1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using Components in Emails

When you insert a component into an email, it becomes an **instance** of that component:

<Info>
  The instance references the master component. You can override content (text, links, image URLs) via overrides, but the design stays linked to the master component.
</Info>

### How instances work

1. **Reference**: The email stores a reference to the component (by name/ID)
2. **Resolution**: When rendering, Mailkick loads the master component
3. **Overrides**: Content overrides are applied (text, URLs, etc.)
4. **Rendering**: The resolved component is rendered with react-email

### Example: Newsletter Header Component

**Component Master** (in library):
```
Newsletter Header Component
├── Logo image (src: "/logo.png")
├── Title text (content: "Weekly Newsletter")
└── Navigation menu
    ├── Link 1 (href: "/about")
    └── Link 2 (href: "/contact")
```

**Instance in Email 1**:
- Uses master design (logo, colors, spacing)
- Override: Title text → "Product Updates"

**Instance in Email 2**:
- Uses master design (same as Email 1)
- Override: Title text → "Monthly Digest"
- Override: Logo src → "/logo-black.png"

<Warning>
  If you change the master component's design (colors, spacing, layout), both Email 1 and Email 2 automatically update with the new design. Only content overrides are preserved.
</Warning>

## Component Types

Components can contain any type of element:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simple elements">
    Text, buttons, images, separators, social links—all work inside components.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Structural elements">
    Groups, flex-rows, and columns can be part of a component structure.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Nested components">
    Components can contain other components (though be careful not to create circular references).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="🎯 Single purpose">
    Each component should have a clear, single purpose (e.g., "Header", "Footer", "CTA Button").
  </Card>
  <Card title="🎨 Use design tokens">
    Build components using tokens from your Style Library, not hardcoded values.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📝 Name clearly">
    Use descriptive names like "Product Card" or "Newsletter Header" instead of "Component 1".
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔄 Keep reusable">
    If you find yourself copying elements often, it's a good candidate for a component.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Component Library

Your component library is accessible from:

- The main navigation menu
- The email editor (insert component button)
- The component editor (for editing existing components)

<Info>
  Components are account-wide, so all your emails can use any component you've created.
</Info>

## Rendering Components

Components are rendered the same way as emails—using react-email. When a component instance is resolved:

1. The master component structure is loaded
2. Overrides are applied to specific elements
3. The component is converted to react-email code
4. It's rendered as part of the email's react-email structure

This ensures components work seamlessly within emails and maintain compatibility across all email clients.
