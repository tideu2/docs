## Overview

The **Mailkick Export** Figma plugin allows you to copy your email designs from Figma and paste them directly into the Mailkick editor. The plugin preserves your layout, typography, colors, and images.

<Note>
You need a [Mailkick account](https://mailkick.app) to use this plugin.
</Note>

## Installation

1. Open Figma and go to **Plugins** > **Browse plugins in Community**
2. Search for "Mailkick Export"
3. Click **Install**

Or install directly from the [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1592219977592212116).

## How to use

### Step 1: Select your design

In Figma, select the frame or elements you want to export. The plugin will show you how many elements are selected.

### Step 2: Copy your email

1. Open the plugin: **Plugins** > **Mailkick Export**
2. Click **Copy Email**
3. The design data is now in your clipboard

### Step 3: Paste in Mailkick

1. Open your email in the [Mailkick editor](https://mailkick.app)
2. Click anywhere in the editor
3. Press `Cmd+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+V` (Windows)
4. Your design will be imported

### Step 4: Import images (optional)

If your design contains images, you'll need to import them separately:

1. In the plugin, click **Export Images (optional)**
2. A ZIP file will be downloaded containing all your images
3. In Mailkick, a modal will appear asking for this ZIP file
4. Drag and drop the ZIP file to upload your images

<Tip>
Images are deduplicated automatically. If you've already uploaded an image, Mailkick will use the existing one instead of re-uploading.
</Tip>

## What gets imported

| Element | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Text (with styles) | Yes |
| Images | Yes |
| Buttons | Yes |
| Layout (auto-layout) | Yes |
| Colors | Yes |
| Borders | Yes |
| Border radius | Yes |
| Spacing | Yes |
| Icons | Yes (as images) |
| Gradients | Partial |
| Effects (shadows) | No |

## Tips for best results

1. **Use Auto Layout** - Frames with auto-layout convert better to responsive email layouts
2. **Keep it simple** - Complex nested structures may not convert perfectly
3. **Name your layers** - Well-named layers make it easier to edit in Mailkick
4. **Use solid colors** - Gradients have limited support in email clients
5. **Design at 600px width** - This is the standard email width

## Troubleshooting

### Images are not showing

Make sure to export and import the images ZIP file. Images are not embedded in the clipboard data.

### Layout looks different

Email clients have limited CSS support. Some Figma layouts may need adjustment in Mailkick for best email compatibility.

### Plugin not working

1. Make sure you have elements selected
2. Try refreshing Figma
3. Reinstall the plugin if issues persist
