Mailkick can serve uploaded images from a **custom image subdomain** (e.g. `image.yourdomain.com`). This improves branding and can help with deliverability since your email assets use your domain.

## Prerequisites

- You must be a **workspace admin** (Settings sections are admin-only).
- You can edit DNS records for your domain.
- Pick a dedicated subdomain (recommended): `image.yourdomain.com`

## Step 1 — Set the image domain in Mailkick

1. Open **Settings → Image Domain**
2. Enter your hostname (example: `image.yourdomain.com`)
3. Click **Get target** (or **Update domain**)

Mailkick will return:
- A **CNAME target** (to point your subdomain to)
- Sometimes, **TXT verification records** (if the domain is already linked elsewhere)

## Step 2 — Configure DNS (TXT + CNAME)

### If TXT verification is required

Add **all TXT records** shown in the UI first, then add the CNAME.

<Tip>
TXT verification is commonly required when the same hostname is already linked to another hosting/Vercel project. Once the domain becomes <strong>active</strong>, you can usually remove the TXT records and keep only the CNAME.
</Tip>

### Add the CNAME

Create a CNAME:
- **Name/Host**: your subdomain (e.g. `image`)
- **Value/Target**: the **CNAME target** shown in Mailkick

## Step 3 — Verify status

Back in **Settings → Image Domain**, click **Refresh status** until it becomes **active**.

Mailkick also checks a health endpoint:

- `https://<your-hostname>/_mailkick/health`

If “Service health” is not OK, wait for DNS propagation and confirm your CNAME is correct.

## What changes once it’s active?

- New and existing image URLs are served from:
  - `https://<your-hostname>/image/<path>`
- Preview/export will use your hostname when generating email HTML/React Email.
