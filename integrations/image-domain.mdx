Mailkick can serve uploaded images from a **custom image subdomain** (e.g. `image.yourdomain.com`). This improves branding and can help with deliverability since your email assets use your domain.

## Prerequisites

- You must be a **workspace admin** (Settings sections are admin-only).
- You can edit DNS records for your domain.
- Pick a dedicated subdomain (recommended): `image.yourdomain.com`

## Step 1 — Set the image domain in Mailkick

1. Open **Settings → Image Domain**
2. Enter your hostname (example: `image.yourdomain.com`)
3. Click **Get target** (or **Update domain**)

Mailkick will return a **CNAME target** to point your subdomain to.

## Step 2 — Add the CNAME record

In your DNS provider, create a CNAME record:

- **Name/Host**: your subdomain (e.g. `image`)
- **Value/Target**: `proxy.mailkick.app`

<Tip>
DNS propagation can take a few minutes. If you use Cloudflare as your DNS provider, make sure the record is set to <strong>DNS only</strong> (grey cloud), not Proxied.
</Tip>

## Step 3 — Verify status

Back in **Settings → Image Domain**, click **Refresh status** until it becomes **active**.

Mailkick checks a health endpoint automatically:

- `https://<your-hostname>/_mailkick/health`

If "Service health" is not OK, wait for DNS propagation and confirm your CNAME is correct.

## What changes once it's active?

- New and existing image URLs are served from:
  - `https://<your-hostname>/image/<path>`
- Preview/export will use your hostname when generating email HTML.
