## Overview

**Overrides** let you customize the content of a component instance in an email while keeping its design linked to the master component. This is the mechanism that connects components in your library to instances in emails.

## The Core Concept

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Master Component" icon="package">
    **In the library**
    
    - Fixed design
    - Fixed structure
    - Source of truth for styles
    - Update once, all instances update
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instance in Email" icon="copy">
    **In your email**
    
    - References the master
    - Can override content
    - Design inherited from master
    - Content can be customized
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What Can Be Overridden?

Overrides allow you to customize **content**, not **design**:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Overridable (Content)">
    - **Text content**: The text inside text elements
    - **Image URLs**: The source URL of images
    - **Links**: URLs for buttons and links (href)
    - **Alt text**: Alt attribute for images
    - **Titles**: Title attribute for buttons
    
    These are content properties that can vary per instance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="❌ Not Overridable (Design)">
    - Colors (come from Style Library tokens)
    - Font sizes (via textStyleId)
    - Spacing (padding, margin)
    - Borders
    - Background colors
    
    *These properties stay linked to the master component*
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Override Format

Overrides are stored as an array or dictionary:

### Array Format (New)

```json
{
  "type": "component",
  "content": "CTA Button",
  "overrides": [
    {
      "elementId": "element-btn-1",
      "content": "Sign up now",
      "href": "https://signup.com"
    },
    {
      "elementId": "element-img-2",
      "src": "https://example.com/new-image.jpg",
      "alt": "Updated image"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Dictionary Format (Legacy)

```json
{
  "type": "component",
  "content": "CTA Button",
  "overrides": {
    "element-btn-1": {
      "content": "Sign up now",
      "href": "https://signup.com"
    },
    "element-img-2": {
      "src": "https://example.com/new-image.jpg"
    }
  }
}
```

## Resolution Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Instance in email">
    Your email contains a component reference (type: "component").
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Load master">
    Mailkick loads the master component from the library.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Apply overrides">
    Overrides are applied to matching elements in the master.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Render">
    The resolved instance is rendered with master design + overridden content.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Real-World Example

Let's say you have a "CTA Button" component:

### Master Component Structure

```json
{
  "id": "cta-button-primary",
  "name": "CTA Button",
  "children": [
    {
      "id": "element-btn-1",
      "type": "button",
      "content": "Click here",
      "properties": {
        "buttonStyleId": "primary",
        "padding": "12px 24px"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Instance in Email with Override

```json
{
  "type": "component",
  "content": "CTA Button",
  "overrides": [
    {
      "elementId": "element-btn-1",
      "content": "Sign up now",
      "href": "https://signup.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Final Rendered Result

The button displays:
- ✅ **Text**: "Sign up now" (from override)
- ✅ **Style**: Primary button style from Style Library (from master)
- ✅ **Link**: "https://signup.com" (from override)
- ✅ **Padding**: "12px 24px" (from master, not overridable)

<Info>
  The design (colors, padding, border radius) comes from the master component and Style Library tokens. Only content properties are overridden.
</Info>

## Element IDs

Each element in a component has a **unique ID** used to reference it in overrides:

- Format: `element-{id}` or just `{id}`
- The ID is preserved during resolution
- Allows precise targeting for overrides

### Finding Element IDs

When editing a component, you can see element IDs in:
- The element properties panel
- The hierarchy breadcrumb
- Component editor inspector

## Modifying the Master Component

<Warning>
  When you modify a master component's design, all emails using that component automatically update with the new styles.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Content overrides are preserved when the master is updated. Only the design changes.
</Info>

### Example: Updating Master Design

**Before**: Master component has `backgroundColor: "#F0F0F0"`

**After**: You change master to `backgroundColor: "#FFFFFF"`

**Result**: All instances in all emails update to white background, but text content overrides remain unchanged.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use clear element structure">
    Give your component elements logical structures so overrides are easy to understand and apply.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Limit overrides to content">
    Only override content properties (text, URLs). For design variants, create separate components instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test after master changes">
    After modifying a master component, check that all emails using it still display correctly with their overrides.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document override points">
    If a component is meant to be customized, document which elements can be overridden in the component name or notes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Override Limitations

<Warning>
  You cannot override:
  - Design tokens (colors, text styles, button styles)
  - Spacing properties (padding, margin)
  - Structural properties (width, height, flex properties)
  - Border styles
</Warning>

If you need different designs, create variant components instead of trying to override design properties.
