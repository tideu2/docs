## Overview

Mailkick lets you translate your emails into multiple languages while keeping everything in sync. Invite **translators** to your workspace — they get a focused editing experience where they can only change text content, without touching your design or layout.

## Adding a Translator

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Team Settings">
    Go to **Settings → Team** in your workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Invite Member">
    Click the **Invite Member** button to open the invitation modal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in the details">
    Enter the translator's **name** and **email address**, then select the **Translator** role from the dropdown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign languages">
    When you select the Translator role, a language selector appears. Pick the languages this translator is responsible for. You must assign at least one language.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the invitation">
    Click **Send Invite**. The translator receives an email with a link to join your workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing languages after invitation

You can add or remove languages for any translator at any time. In **Settings → Team**, click the language badges next to their name — a popover opens with checkboxes to update their assigned languages instantly.

## What Can a Translator Access?

Translators have a **focused, restricted view** of your workspace. They only see what they need to translate — nothing more.

### What they see

  <Card title="Email editor" icon="pen">
    A simplified editor with only the canvas and a translation sidebar — no design panels, no element toolbar.

</CardGroup>

## How Translation Works

When a translator opens an email, they get a streamlined editing experience designed for content work only.

### Editing content

- **Single click** on any text or button to start editing — no need to double-click
- The translation sidebar shows the email's **title**, **subject line**, and a list of all **images** with their alt text and links
- All text elements and button labels are editable directly on the canvas

<Info>
  Translators can edit: text content, button labels, image alt text, image links, email title, and subject line.
</Info>

### What they can't change

Translators cannot modify the email structure or design:

- No drag-and-drop (elements stay where they are)
- No adding or deleting elements
- No style changes (colors, fonts, spacing, padding)
- No layout changes (columns, groups, order)
- **Localized components are locked** — components that have already been translated are read-only for translators. Only admins and members can edit the master component.

<Tip>
  This means your design stays pixel-perfect across all languages. Translators focus on words, you keep control of the look.
</Tip>

### Translation groups

Emails in different languages can be linked together as a **translation group**. This makes it easy to see all versions of the same email side by side in the email list.

When an admin creates a translation from a master email (via the **Translate** action), the new copy is automatically linked to the original and assigned the target language.

## Validating Translations

Once a translator finishes their work, they can mark the email as **Ready** to signal it's done.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review content">
    The translator reviews all text, button labels, subject line, and image alt texts in the editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set status to Ready">
    From the email list, the translator changes the email status from **Draft** to **Ready**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Admin review">
    An admin or member can review the translation, leave comments if needed, and proceed to sync or send.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Use **comments** in the editor to communicate with translators. You can leave notes on specific elements to provide context or request changes.
